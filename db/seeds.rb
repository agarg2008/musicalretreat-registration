  ############ Listen up, because this is a hack!!!  
  #  Having a dropdown for flute choir was deemed confusing, so the easiest fix is
  #  to remove the requirement here so it doesn't show up on the elective page then 
  #  look specifically for this elective (by name) when figuring out which evals 
  #  are required.  EnsemblePrimary.need_eval_for has the code that looks for "Flute Choir" 
  #  by name.  So if you get rid of Flute Choir, or change the instrument ID for flute or piccolo, 
  #  watch out!!!

But it should -- it should get lots of respect!! And if you join the Clarinet Choir, you can help prove everybody wrong and stop all those nasty and false things they are saying about clarinets.  So in some sense it is your moral duty to sign up for Clarinet Choir.  Whether or not you are a clarinet player."
