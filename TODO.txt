Fix downloaded_at:
   get rid of the field in the registration and payment records
   add a new table that has type (registration, payment, .... ?) and the time
   downloaders just put a record in that table, but the assumption is that all would be downloaded
   [[ ?? should this table record the ids of the records it downloads?  thinking not ]]

Transform the booleans:
   Do a replace of ^true or \ttrue or true$ ??

Put the date/time in the file name for downloaded files.

Split out fields in payment:
  
  -- add a new field payment_type:  possible values "Check" "CreditCard" or "Other"
  -- backfill: in cases of Online/CC fill payment_type = CreditCard and empty check_number
