In this section you will choose and rank at least three and up to five electives.  You must
choose at least three electives in case one or more is not available at a time compatible with
your schedule.
</p>
<p>
This is a ranking
for electives only.  Your chamber selections will be prioritized higher than electives
unless you tell us otherwise (use the comments box on the Summary page to do so).

<div id="short-help">
Drag from left column to right to choose an elective.  Move a choice up or down in the 
right list.  Use the drop-down to choose an instrument or voice if the elective requires a choice.  
You must choose at least three electives and choose an instrument or voice for all your choices that
require a choice.

How to do it
<ul>
<li>All the available electives are in the left column
<li>If you hover your mouse cursor over an elective name, you will see a description of the elective below Elective Choices
<li>To choose an elective you drag it from the left column to the right column where you see
"Drop here."  To drag a selection, put the mouse cursor over the item, hold down the right mouse button, then
move the cursor to the Elective Choices area.  The elective will follow your cursor to the right column
<li>You can move up to five electives to the Elective Choices area
<li>The electives in the Elective Choices area are in rank order
<li>You can re-order your list by dragging a selection up or down in the list
<li>You can remove a selection from your list by clicking the red X next to an elective in the Elective Choices area
It will move to the Available Electives column so you can choose it again if you change your mind
<li>For some electives you need to tell us which instrument or vocal part is for you.  Click on the white area that 
says "- Instrument -" next to the elective name and make your selection from the list
<li>To go on to the next step (your self-evaluations) you need to choose at least three
electives and supply an instrument or voice for all of your chosen electives that have a white 
"Instrument" box next to their names 
<li>When you are finished selecting, ordering, and choosing instruments, push the Next button to go on to the next page
<li>You can always push the browser refresh button to start back at the beginning of this step
