In this section you will choose and rank up to 5 electives.  This is a ranking
for electives only.  Your chamber selections will be prioritized higher than electives
unless you tell us otherwise (use the comments box on the Summary page to do so).
</p>
<p>
How to do it
<ul>
<li>All the available electives are on the left
<li>If you hover the mouse cursor over an elective name, you will see a description of the elective on the lower right
<li>To select an elective you drag it from the left column to the column on your right where you see
"Drop here"
<li>You can move up to five electives to your "elective choices" area
<li>The electives you select there are in rank order
<li>You can re-order you list by dragging a selection up or down
<li>You can remove a selection by clicking the red X in your elective choices area
<li>For some electives you need to tell us which instrument or vocal part is yours.  Click on the white area that 
says "- Instrument -" next to the elective name and make your selection
<li>To go on to the next step you need to select at least one elective and supply an Instrument for all of your 
choices with a white "Instrument" box next to their names in the elective choices area
<li>When you are selecting, ordering, and choosing Instruments, push the Submit button to go on to the next page
</ul>
