<p>
During the afternoon, MMR singers and instrumentalists participate in a variety of 
Chamber ensembles and elective classes that provide an opportunity for campers to shift and expand their musical focus. These ensembles and electives will meet once each day for one hour. 
Campers who come with a pre-arranged ensemble are guaranteed the 
opportunity to be coached together and may choose either one 
or two sessions of coaching. Those coming independently will 
be assigned to ensembles using the information on the self-evaluation. 
Most electives are scheduled in only one session each afternoon 
and may conflict with each other or with assigned chamber ensembles. 
</p>
<p>
Please Keep in Mind:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>There are three sessions each afternoon for chamber ensembles, electives and free tim</li>
  <li>A typical afternoon program would be one or two chamber ensembles and one elective or free time.   Two electives and an ensemble or free time are also possible</li>
  <li>Requests for a second ensemble or elective will be filled only if faculty and other players are available</li>
  <li>Late registrants and those who do not complete this form before June 1st are not guaranteed an individual  chamber ensemble.</li>
</ul>
