<h2>Evaluations</h2>
<p>
In order to place you appropriately, the faculty 
needs an assessment of your level of experience in the instruments you will be playing
in large ensemble, chamber groups, and electives.  
</p>
<p>
You will now fill out evaluations for: 
<%= @ensemble_primary.need_eval_for.map{|id|Instrument.find(id).display_name}.join(",") %>

<%= form_for @ensemble_primary, url: {action: "evaluation_summary", method: "post"} do |form| %>
   <%= form.hidden_field :id %>

   <%= form.fields_for :evaluations do |evaluation| %>
      <%= render :partial => Evaluation.find(evaluation.object.id).partial_name, :object => evaluation %>
      <hrule/>
   <% end %>
<p/>
<%= submit_tag "Submit" %>
<% end %>
