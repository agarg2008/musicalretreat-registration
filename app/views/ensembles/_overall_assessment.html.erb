You generally sound good on your instrument, and sight reading is not a problem.  You are attentive to all markings in the score.  You pay attention to blend, balance, dynamics, style, and basic phrasing on a first reading.  If you make a mistake, you can usually get back in without stopping." %>

You know much of the standard repertoire.  If your partners make a mistake, you can often bring them back in without stopping.  You consistently sound excellent on your instrument and aim for cohesive musical expressiveness with attention to fine detail on a first reading." %>
