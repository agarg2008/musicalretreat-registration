Dear <%= @name %>,

<p>
We are writing to remind you that you have not yet completed the online evaluation/ensemble selection form for MMR <%= Year.this_year %>.
The deadline for completion is June 1.  
Please do so as soon as possible so we can help if there are any problems.  We want to make your week at Midsummer as satisfying as possible.
</p>

<p>
You can access the instructions and form using 
<a href="http://musicalretreat.org/self-evaluation-and-ensembleelective-preferences">this link</a>.
You will need to access your account using the same email and password you used to register.
You will not be able to use a touchscreen device to fill out the evaluation forms.
</p>

<p>
Filling out the choices and forms should take no more than ten minutes, but you need to finish the forms in one session, otherwise you will
have to start over.   Your selections are not complete until you 
<ul>
<li>arrive at the <i>Ensemble Preference Summary</i> page, then
<li>check the box saying you have read and acknowledged the Waiver and Release form, then
<li>push the FINISH button.
</ul>
You will then be returned to the main registration page and you will see the message <i>Ensemble and elective choices complete</i>.  You will also see a button
allowing you to review your evaluation selections, and you can also start over and fill out the forms again is you want.
</p>

<p>
Please send email to <a href="mailto:midsummer@musicalretreat.org">midsummer@musicalretreat.org</a> or 
<a href="mailto:webmaster@musicalretreat.org">webmaster@musicalretreat.org</a> if you have trouble.
