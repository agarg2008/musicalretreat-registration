Dear MMR Faculty Member,
<p>
As you probably know, MMR faculty will register online this year to make it easier to manage dorm and meal assignment, T-Shirt and wine glass orders, etc.
</p>

<p>
Here's how it will work for you.
<ul>
<li> We have already set up on online account for you using the email address that received this message.
<ul><li><i>You must register using this email address in order to get the faculty rate.</i> </li> </ul>
</li>

<li> Go to the <a href = "http://home.mmr-registration.org/registration">main registration page</a> and there you can log in and register. </li>
<li> You should see no charges in the shopping cart.  If you do, <a href="mailto:webmaster@musicalretreat.org">let me know</a></li>
<li> Make your dorm and room selection, and also donation, T-Shirt, and wine glass order</li>
<li> You should only be charged for the following items:
  <ul>
    <li>Single room charge if you request it</li>
    <li>T-Shirts in excess of one (you get one free!)</li>
    <li>Wine glasses</li>
    <li>Donation</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li> In the middle of the form you will see a selection Participant or Non-Participant.  Please select non-participant.
<ul><li>Yes we know you will actually be participating, but if you check participant and select and instrument or voice, you will 
have to do a self-evaluation.  Since you probably will be reading the evaluations for your voice/instrument it means you
would be evaluating yourself, which might be awkward especially if you lied in filling out the evaluation.  So let's just avoid that.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>You will get a confimation email immediately after completing the registration;  you can check back on the main registration site and 
view your registtion to see if we processed any payment.</li>
<li>You may pay online using a credit card or by a check sent by postal mail to:<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessica Stittsworth, MMR Registrar
  <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18775 NW Ukiah St.,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Portland, OR 97229<br>
</li>
<li>You may access your account to check your balance at any time using your email and password.</li>
</ul>
