Greetings from the Midsummer Musical Retreat Registration System:

SELF EVALUATION AND ENSEMBLE/ELECTIVE PREFERENCE FORMS ARE NOW ONLINE

Midsummer Musical Retreat is adopting an online format to collect your
self-evaluation, afternoon ensemble plans, and elective preferences.
This is new for us all!

The online form must be completed by June 1.  This is a hard deadline.

The online process has only four parts (one for Morning Ensemble
choice, one for Afternoon Small Ensemble choices, one for Elective
choices, and one for Self Evaluations).  You should be able to
complete it in 10 minutes or less.

You will need your login email and password for MMR, but you can reset
your password on the registration site if you have forgotten.  We
strongly recommend that you read everything carefully as you go along.
There is a text box at the end of the process if you feel there are
things you want that did not get covered in the form.

You may move back through form using your browser's BACK button if you need to change something, 
but nothing is saved until you press the FINISH button on the last page.  If you leave the site without 
completing your forms or you want to revise your choices after finishing, you will have to start over.  
You do so by re-visiting the main registration pages at http://home.mmr-registration.org/registration
and there will be an option to clear and restart your Ensemble choices.  

If you have problems contact us at (800)471-2419 or (206)324-6689 or email to midsummer@musicalretreat.org

The site will not work properly on touchscreen devices like phones or tablets.
We have tested the site on both Macs and PCs using the Chrome and Internet Explorer browsers.  
No guarantees for anything else! 

If you are coming with a pre-arranged group, all group members must agree on the following things prior to filling out the form
   Who is the designated contact person for the group
   Whether the group wants one or two coached hours per day

The contact person alone will fill out the names of all members, and
also whether or not the group will pre-select music, and if so will
need to supply the name of the piece(s).  All other members of the
group will simply supply the name and email address of the contact
person.

Pre-arranged Ensembles will be prioritized above Elective choices for all members of the group.

You will be asked to complete Self Evaluations for all instruments and
voices you have indicated that you want to use at MMR in a large
ensemble, afternoon ensemble, or elective.

Finally, you will see all your choices on a Summary Page. Review them
carefully. If you need to change anything, use your browser's BACK
button to go back and change things.

You are encouraged to use all the &quot;comments&quot; text boxes to
tell us anything else about your expectations for MMR.  Also, be sure
to tell us about any accommodations we can make for any disabilities
that impact your participation in the program.

To complete the process, read the Liability Waiver and Release and
check the box acknowledging your agreement.  After you click FINISH,
you will have to start the process again to make any changes.

Go to http://home.mmr-registration.org/registration to get started.
