	<ul>
	  <li><strong>Paying By Credit Card or PayPal</strong>
	    <ul>
	      <li>This year you can pay your deposit or balance using a credit card or a PayPal account.</li>
	      <li>On the registration form you will be given the option of paying either the deposit or the entire balance by credit card or PayPal.</li>
	      <li>If you opt to pay by credit card or PayPal, you will be directed to a secure third-party site that will process your payment.</li>
	      <li>MMR never sees your credit card number.</li>
	      <li>We will charge you a fee of $0.30 plus 3% of the cost, which is what the credit-card company charges
		us.  This will be approximately $4.80 if you pay the deposit only, and $25.05 if you pay the balance onine.</li>
	      <li>You can pay the deposit by credit card, then send a check for the balance when it is due.</li>
	      <li>If you pay by credit card, your application is considered complete (for the purpose of housing assignment) immediately when you register;  if you mail a check, the postmark date is used.</li>
	      <li><strong>Credit card fees are non-refundable</strong></li>
	    </ul>
	  <li><strong>Online Registration</strong>
	    <ul>
	      <li>In order to register online, you need an email address and a password. The email address is your user-id.</li>
	      <li>There can be only one registration per email address, so a couple registering together would either have to do so using two emails, or mail in paper registration forms.</li>
	      <li>Visit the registration site at <a href="http://registration.musicalretreat.org/registration/index">http://registration.musicalretreat.org/registration/index</a> to establish an account or ask to have your password changed.</li>
	      <li>When you use the online system we will remind you about things like the amount of and due date for your registration balance.</li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	  <p/>
	  <li><strong>Registration and Fees</strong>
	    <ul>
	      <li> Applications must include the deposit of $150. A registration will only be considered
		complete when both the form and the deposit have been received.
		The application date will be determined by the postmark of the deposit (mailed check) or time of registration (online payment).</li>
	      <li> The address to send the deposit check will appear on the confirmation page and email (online registration) or on
		the paper registration form.</li>
	      <li>Two participants requesting a room together will be placed in housing according
		to the completed application date of the deposit of the second roommate to register.
		Both deposits must be received before housing can be assigned.</li>
	      <li>All fees are due in full on <%= RegDates.registration_balance_due.strftime("%b %d, %Y") %>. including registration,
		tuition, housing and meals.  If you register online, you will be reminded by email.</li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	  <p/>
	  <li><strong>Wait Lists & Section Caps</strong>
	    <ul>
	      <li>All sections in the large ensembles will have numerical caps.
		This includes the orchestra, band, chorus and string orchestra.
		When the sections are filled, the registrar will establish waiting
		lists on a first-come, first-served basis.
		People who have been wait-listed will be notified of
		their status by <%= RegDates.wait_list_notification.strftime("%b %d, %Y") %> and given the option to remain on the list.
		A full refund will be sent to those withdrawing their application at this time.
		The deposit will be held for those electing to stay on the wait list.
		A full refund will be made to those on the wait list for whom there
		is no space when MMR begins.
