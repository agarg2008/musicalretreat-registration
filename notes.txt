Server address is 
node1650.speedyrails.net

SSH access as user deploy, no password, need SSH private key.

Github repository is here:
https://github.com/hankssj/musicalretreat-registration

There is a key registered so the deploy scripts pull directly from this repository.

Two applications, one production mode, one development mode.
The applications are musicalretreat and mmrdev respectively, as can be seen in  /var/www/apps

Database:
Production Credentials in the file /var/www/apps/musicalretreat/shared/config/database.yml 
Development Credentials in the file /var/www/apps/mmrdev/shared/config/database.yml 

Development uses a different database mmrdev and a different username and password


Production:
Application: musicalretreat
Preview address: musicalretreat.node1650.speedyrails.net
http://home.mmr-registration.org/registration

Development:
Application: mmrdev
Preview address: mmrdev.node1650.speedyrails.net
http://development.mmr-registration.org

Deployment:  
They provide ~/deploy.musicalretreat.rb
Once only:  cd to project, 'capify .' which creates Capfile and ./config/deploy.rb then copy their 
deploy.musicalretreat.rb over the top of deploy.rb

Then 
cap projection deploy
cap development deploy
from a project directory (seems like it doesn't matter which one since the deploy file is the same)?
